    <h1>Basic HTML tags and attributes</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language used to create web pages. It consists of several elements or tags which are combined in specific ways to structure the content displayed by a browser, such as headings, paragraphs, links, and images. Here are some basic HTML tags:
    </p>
    <h2>html tag</h2>
    <p>
        This is the root element that starts an HTML document. Everything inside it should be related to
        web pages, including the `head` and `body`.
    </p>
    <h2>head tag</h2>
    <p>
        This contains metadata about the page such as the title of the page or links to external resources like
        stylesheets or scripts. It's typically not visible in the final rendered output but is used by browsers for caching and SEO purposes. The `title` attribute is a commonly used element within the `head` that allows you to specify the title displayed on the browser tab when it loads the page.
    </p>
    <h2>body tag</h2>
    <p>
        This defines where most of the content of an HTML document appears, between the html, head and body tags there should be nothing else. The `onload` attribute can be used to execute JavaScript code that runs once the entire web page has finished loading into memory (loaded completely).
    </p>
    <h2>title tag</h2>
    <p>
        This is a required HTML element that contains metadata about your webpage, such as its name or
        subject matter; it appears in the browser's title bar when you open a link and often also serves as the
        document's title for search engines like Google. The `content` attribute specifies the content of the `title` tag, which is usually displayed inside angle brackets on web pages.
    </p>
    <h2>h1, h2 tags</h2>
    <p>
        These are used to create headings in an HTML page. They can have a variety of attributes such as `style`, `class`, and `id` that allow you to customize their appearance; they typically nest one within another, with the highest level (e.g., `h1`) preceding all lower levels (`h2` through h6).
    </p>
    <h2>'p' tag</h2>
    <p>
        This is used to create paragraph elements in an HTML document. It separates blocks of text and allows browsers to add line breaks automatically after it if not explicitly specified by the user. The `style`
        attribute can be set using CSS, which affects the appearance of the element within the browser.
    </p>
    <h2>'a' tag</h2>
    <p>
        This is used for creating links on a web page. It creates an anchor that points to another location
        such as another HTML document or resource on the Web. When clicked, it triggers navigation and can also trigger actions related to the target URL (such as form submissions). The `href` attribute specifies the link's destination, while other attributes like `rel`, `title`, and `target` provide additional information about its role within a page or how it should behave when accessed.
    </p>
    <h2>'img' tag</h2>
    <p>
        This is used for embedding images in HTML documents; many other elements depend on this one because they display graphics. The `src` attribute specifies the location of the image file, while others like `alt`, `height`, and `width` specify its appearance or behavior within an HTML page.
    </p>

    These are just a few basic examples. HTML provides many more tags to help you organize your content, add features like forms, tables, and navigation menus, as well as many other advanced techniques for creating dynamic websites with JavaScript.
